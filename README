TEI with Music Browser
======================

This project comprises a collection of XSLTs for transforming Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI) encoded documents which make reference to
music using a number of TEI customisations into documents which render
in a Web browser with music examples, references, allusions, and
analytic examples made highly interactive. Along with the XSLTs are
provided JavaScript components and some server-side software
components which enable some of the rendering and interactivity of
musical components in documents, and retrieval of additional
information from various different sources.

The work is being carried out as part of the Purcell Plus project
<http://www.purcellplus.org/>.
